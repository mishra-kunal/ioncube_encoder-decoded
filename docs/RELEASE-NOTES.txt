ionCube PHP Encoder 12.0 Release Notes
======================================

Unless marked otherwise, changes refer to the Encoder products within
this release; GUI refers to the GUI supplied with the Windows and MacOS 
versions.

Version 12.0.2 - 7 September 2022
---------------------------------

* GUI: Show project path in status line while hovering over recent items
  in the startup panel.

* GUI: Improved help access and handling of F1 on Windows. Help button 
  added to the project settings dialog to show related help. 

* GUI: New feature for easier setting of lengthy text in the project settings
  "Custom 'No Loader' expression" field.

* GUI: Font for the project settings custom header text field changed 
  to a monospaced font.

* GUI: Minor fix with exporting some project settings in command line Encoder 
  project file format.

* Encoder: Fix for issue encoding some PHP 8.1 code on 32 bit architectures.

* Loader: Fix for issue using PHP 8.1 encoded files containing custom
  error messages.
 
 
Version 12.0.1 - 24 August 2022
-------------------------------

* GUI: New language option for bundling PHP 7.4 and 8.1 encoded files
  together as a single file.

* GUI: Bundling performance boosted by using the --only-include-encoded-files
  Encoder option to only process files to be encoded, eliminating duplicate 
  processing of other files when adding to a bundle.

* GUI: Items added to the Project menu to open a terminal command line
  window on the source, target and project settings locations. 
  The terminal program can be selected in a new Applications > Terminal 
  section within preferences. The program to be run by the GUI is also shown 
  in the status line when highlighting these menu items.
  EXPERIMENTAL: This feature is experimental and may change in 
  future releases.

* GUI: Close Section item added to the Log Tree right-click context menu 
  that closes the corresponding section of the log tree.

* GUI: Excluded Directories node added to the Log Tree.

* GUI: F5 accelerator added to trigger the default build action
  (same action as using the play (build) button).

* GUI: Help menu item added for submitting a feature request.

* GUI: Help menu item added to review release notes.

* GUI: Miscellaneous minor adjustments.

* GUI: Various GUI user guide updates, and describe some previously
  unmentioned features.  

* The --without-runtime-loader-support Encoder option is now deprecated.
  It is still recognised but undocumented, and is now the default.
  This change means that PHP code at the start of encoded files that
  would attempt to install the Loader using the dl() PHP function will
  no longer be present. dl() has been disabled by default in most
  PHP configurations since PHP 5.3.0, so the code would be ineffective 
  and unnecessary bloat, which this change eliminates.

* A new option --with-runtime-loader-support is added for back 
  compatibility, and includes the PHP runtime install code
  mentioned above in the header of encoded files. Note that runtime
  Loader install requires dl() to be enabled, and this is unlikely 
  to be the case in general. The usual way to install the Loader 
  is via the php.ini file.

* The default non-runtime install PHP code at the start of encoded 
  files is updated to include a test for the case where a file must be
  corrupted (the PHP header being processed rather than the encoded 
  payload when the Loader is installed implies the file is not recognised
  as encoded, i.e. corrupted). A custom action or message for when a file 
  cannot be processed is intentionally unaffected by this change to
  retain previous behaviour.
  

Version 12.0.0 - 12 August 2022
-------------------------------

* Support is added for encoding files using PHP 8.1 syntax.

* Minor Loader change - From PHP 8, ioncube_loader_iversion() now returns an 
  integer type rather than an integer as a string. e.g. 120000 rather 
  than "120000" for Loader version 12.0.0

* GUI - the option to enable short open tags in the UI is unavailable if 
  encoding as PHP 8 and will be removed in a future version.
  
* Updated default text if no Loader is installed.

* Minor fixes.


Deprecated features

* The --no-short-open-tags option will be removed in a future version as 
  short open tags are removed as a concept in PHP 8. 

* The --disable-dynamic-decoding feature is no longer required and is
  now deprecated.


Removal of legacy features

* The options --allow-untrusted-extensions and --disallow-untrusted-extensions 
  have been undocumented and had no effect from version 8, but have still been
  recognised for back compatibility. These have now been removed. 

* The legacy --allow-asp-tags option that was still recognised but removed from
  documentation and the GUI many years ago is now fully removed.


Version 11.0.2 - 10 December 2021
---------------------------------

This minor release provides GUI and cosmetic documentation changes only.

* Refine the toolbar on MacOS.

* Resolve scaling issue with vertical toolbar orientation on MacOS.

* Fix for FTP hostname showing as unset in project settings (special
  edition GUI).

* Fix for custom FTP port not taking effect (special edition GUI).

* Improve news content fetching.

* Cosmetic documentation changes.


Version 11.0.1 - 27 November 2021
---------------------------------

* Update for Linux, FreeBSD and MacOS versions. 


Version 11.0.0 - November 2021
------------------------------

* Support is added for encoding files using PHP 7.4 syntax

* Added --skip to fully ignore project files or directories. 
  Unlike --ignore, which ignores items but will still 
  traverse directories so any matching --keep rules can be
  applied, --skip will fully ignore items. This may reduce 
  encoding times and is recommended over using --ignore.

* License creator program (make_license)
  - Added --decode-format to specify the output format when
    decoding license files. Output can be in the legacy 
    format or various json formats.

  - Added --compat to enable selected compatibility with
    previous versions. Currently this may be used 
    with the value "no-bool-props" to request legacy
    behaviour for parsing of boolean property values. 

  - Added support for Boolean property features
    Unquoted license property values of true and false 
    will now be stored and returned as boolean values 
    rather than strings if queried via the Loader API.
    The new option --compat no-bool-props can be used to
    obtain previous behaviour, or bool values could be
    expressed as strings by quoting, 
    e.g. --add-property foo="true"  

* GUI - New features, enhancements and bug fixes, including:
  - Support for high and per-dpi screens.

  - Native MacOS Dark Mode support.
  
  - Populate license fields in create license dialog from an
    existing license file by drag/drop.

  - New JSON formats when decoding license files.

  - The size of project and directory history has been increased.

  - Support for the new Encoder skip feature with project
    tree settings.

* Fix for empty license property values
  - Empty arrays can now be specified as property values with { }

* Fix for displaying floating point property values
  - Floating point property values are now displayed as expected 
    when decoded in legacy mode.


PLEASE NOTE as mentioned above that the license file creator
that comes with the Pro and Cerberus editions now stores 
boolean properties as booleans rather than strings, e.g. 
  --add-property foo=true 
This behaviour is as would be expected, but differs from that
of previous releases. The old behaviour can be obtained by
expressing the value as a string or with a new compatibility
option.


Version 10.2.2 - April 2019
---------------------------

* Fix for the version 10.2.1 PHP 7.1 and 7.2 encoders where a dynamic key could 
be bound to a closure within a function rather than the function itself.


Version 10.2.1 - February 2019
------------------------------

* GUI preference added to better support HiDPI displays on Windows.

* Fix for script-level dynamic keys not being recognised by the 7.1 
and 7.2 encoders.

* Fix for a memory leak that could occur when using obfuscation with the
7.1 and 7.2 encoders.

* Correction to help text for "file:" type external keys.

* Some corrections to the User Guide.


Version 10.2.0 - February 2018
------------------------------

* New Encoder for PHP 7.2 language features.

* Added --bundle and --add-to-bundle options that allow
  multiple encodings to be bundled into one file with short forms
  -B and -A, respectively. 

* Added a --keep-comments option that means header comments will be 
  prefixed to an extra encoding appended to a bundle.

* Fix for a crash that could occur when the Encoder was attempting
to acquire a licence for itself and permissions on the 
licensing directory meant that files could not be created.

* Fix for an issue in the 7.1 Encoder whereby private methods were 
not called if there was an overriding method in a sub-class. 
Specifically, there was a call to the private method from a parent 
method and that parent method had itself been called from the child class.

* Fix for incorrect yield from parsing corresponding to PHP bug 74302 
(https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=74302).


Version 10.0.1 - August 2017
----------------------------

* Fix for possible mangling of class type hints on parameters.


Version 10.0.0 - August 2017
----------------------------

* The PHP Encoder for PHP 7.1 language features is included.

* GUI: Updates to the GUI for support of PHP 7.1

* GUI: Removed option to disable Dynamic Decoding. Projects previously
  encoded with dynamic decoding disabled will still work as normal

* Documentation updates and fixes.

Functional changes from previous versions
-----------------------------------------

* The option --disable-dynamic-decoding option has been deprecated and 
  is no longer documented.



Version 9.0.5 - November 2016
-----------------------------

* Commands --acquire-license and --release-license have been changed
  to --activate and --deactivate, although --acquire-license and
  --release-license can still be used.

* GUI: Changes to some labels to follow the update from aquiring to
  activating a license.

* The command line Encoder defaults to encoding for PHP 5.6+ if no
  language option is specified.

* Updated examples, showing more of the protection features of the Encoder.

* Documentation updates.


Version 9.0.4 - 11 November 2016
--------------------------------

* Fix for problem with the __DIR__ constant whereby it would not be
  processed correctly if part of one of PHP 5.6's constant expressions.

* Fix for problem with the __FILE__ constant whereby it would be
  replaced with the path to the source file rather than the encoded 
  file.

* Fix for closures not being found if they are used in a namespace
  and obfuscation of functions is used.

* GUI: Minor fixes.

* GUI: New status bar indicator to warn if Encoder version selection
  is lower than it could be.

* Documentation updates.

* Please note that version 9.0.3 was not generally released.


Version 9.0.2 - 12 October 2015
-------------------------------

* GUI: Avoid generating command line option --keep for folders in
  cases where this is implied by the use of other options.

* GUI: Fix for emitting unnecessary --copy/--encrypt options
  for folders that had first been set to non-default processing rules
  and then excluded from the project.

* OSX GUI: Rearrange controls to reduce the height of the project 
  settings dialog to fit on an 11" Mac book air screen.

* OSX GUI: Fix for not opening a project file when double clicked unless
  the application is already running.

* Documentation updates.

Functional changes from previous versions
-----------------------------------------

* OSX GUI: The option to bundle Loaders when building a project is
  removed. Including Loaders with a project is not recommended, but
  if desired, this is better achieved by including Loaders in the 
  project source or with a post-encoding step.

Deprecated features
-------------------

* Windows GUI: The option to bundle Loaders when building a project 
  will be removed in a future release. Including Loaders with a project
  is not recommended as it can result in project bloat and distribution
  of old Loaders. If necessary, it can be easily achieved with more
  flexibility than the current feature by including Loaders in the 
  project source or with a post-encoding step.


Version 9.0.1 - 19th August 2015
--------------------------------

* Fix for PHP 5.6 magic method __debugInfo not being excluded from obfuscation.

* Fix for an issue where a function call in a switch may result in the 
  incorrect branch being executed.

* Fix for the 64-bit Linux encoders where it does not encode ints longer than 
  the 32-bit MAX_INT correctly.

* Fix for memory leak when writing the encoded files.

* Addition to User Guide regarding the uniqueness of encoding key values.


Version 9.0.0 - 11 May 2015
---------------------------

* Language support: Encoder added to encode scripts using PHP 5.6
  language syntax, plus Encoders for earlier versions of the PHP grammar.

* Code security: Support for external protection keys, just-in-time (JIT)
  decoding of protected code, and an innovative new code protection
  mechanism using dynamic run-time generated encryption keys. 

* Documentation updates and fixes.

Changes from previous versions
------------------------------

* Encoder naming changes: 
    * The PHP 4 Encoder is renamed from ioncube_encoder to
      ioncube_encoder4.

    * Current Encoders are suffixed with _9.0

    For Linux and FreeBSD

    * All Encoders are now located in a bin directory.

    * A shell script ioncube_encoder.sh is provided to launch the
      Encoder. Shell script options select current, legacy or obsolete
      Encoders, as well as the desired PHP language version. On Linux,
      32 or 64 bit executables are selected automatically.
      Using the shell script to launch the Encoder is recommended to
      hide future naming changes to the actual Encoder programs.

  restrictions; available with command line encoding only. Supported
  with Loader 4.6.2 and higher.

* GUI: In the dialog displayed on startup if opening the last active
  project file fails, it is now possible to tell the GUI to forget the
  project file via the dialog as well as via the File menu.

* GUI: Improvements to interface behaviour when using drag/drop of
  server data files on the create license dialog.

* GUI: Feature added to allow browsing for a server data file as well
  as drag drop when creating license files.

* GUI: New toolbar icons for the OS X GUI.

* GUI: Many minor GUI adjustments.

* Fix for issue where a loop with a trivial condition could cause an
  infinite loop in the encoder.

  function not being found in the global namespace even if it had been
  added to an obfuscation exclusion file.

* Fix for incorrect handling when the path to the encoding target does
  not fully exist. In this case an error will now be produced or the
  target path will be created if using the new --create-target option.

* PDF documentation updates and corrections.

* Windows - Licensing fixes for legacy (version 7) and obsolete encoders.


Version 8.2.0 - 31 January 2014
-------------------------------

* GUI: Initial release of the OSX GUI.
  
* GUI: Added Project Wizard. This can automatically setup a project using
  a few basic settings.
  
* GUI: A "Quickstart" tab has been added to project settings. This
  consolidates the essential settings onto one tab, allowing these to
  be easily changed in one place.  Settings that have been added to
  this tab are still present on their original tabs.

* GUI: An "Actions" tab has been added to the project settings. The
  "Post-encoding command" from the "Miscellaneous" tab has been moved
  here, and now additional pre/post encoding/packaging steps can be
  specified.

* GUI: Encoding using legacy or obsolete Encoders is now determined on
  a per-project basis instead of a program-wide property. As a result,
  the Encoder version can now be selected on the "Miscellaneous"
  project settings tab. A restart is no longer required to switch
  Encoder versions.

* GUI: Encoding and licensing options have been moved out of the
  "Project" menu and into new "Encode" and "Licensing" menus
  respectively. Projects can now be built using any present Encoder
  through a new "Build With..." menu.
  
* GUI: The "Encoders" tab in the general preferences window has been
  merged into the "Project Defaults" tab. Information about the
  required Loaders for each Encoder version can be found by hovering
  over the respective option.

  cancelled.

* Fix for garbled output with the Unix Encoders if the licensing
  lock file cannot be accessed.

* Documentation updates.


Version 8.1.0 - 9 October 2013
------------------------------

* Optional compiled code class and method name obfuscation added to
  the PHP 5, 5.3 and 5.4 Encoders.

* The obfuscation exclusion list has an enhanced syntax with separate
  sections to specify the names of functions, classes and methods
  that are to be excluded from obfuscation.

* GUI: Added new startup panel. The startup panel displays the latest
  news and updates related to the Encoder or Loaders, as well as
  displaying tutorials related to using the Encoder when they become
  available.
  
* GUI: Added new security checklist functionality. The strength of 
  project encoding options is now clearly visible by looking at a
  new coloured gauge in the status bar, and a checklist can be
  accessed via the "Project" menu or by clicking the security gauge.

* GUI: Added functionality to check support status from the program. 
  A new indicator on the status bar indicates the current support
  status. More detailed information can be accessed via the "About" menu,
  or by clicking on the correspondnig status bar indicator. Support
  can be automatically checked on start up.

* GUI: Added functionality to automatically check for new Encoders and
  Loaders on startup. An alert is given when new versions of either are
  available for download.

* GUI: Added tool bar option to close the current open project.
  
* GUI: Added functionality to generate random include and obfuscation keys.

* GUI: Significantly decreased the time that may be required for the program 
  to start.

* GUI: Minor bug fixes.

* Minor functionality changes to accommodate new GUI changes.

* Fix for issue in the PHP 5.4 Encoder where optimisation of the bytecode
  could produce an incorrect return from a function.


Version 8.0.2 - 19 June 2013
----------------------------

* Windows: Fix for issue where network adapters may not be detected.

* Fix for faulty output if no network adapters are detected.


Version 8.0.1 - 7 June 2013
---------------------------

* Fix for potential issue with the PHP 5.4 Encoder and calls to
  internal functions where a returned result is ignored.
  

Version 8.0.0 - 8 May 2013
--------------------------

* The PHP Encoder for PHP 5.4 language features is included.

* Options for automated license acquisition and release via the Internet
  for Linux, FreeBSD and OS X versions have been added. 

* A feature to query for availability of new versions has been added.

* Option to allow scripts with file based domain restrictions to have domain
  name checks skipped when run via PHP CLI for consistency with the behaviour
  of license based restrictions. 

* Running the OS X Encoder with a relative PATH is now supported.

* The obsolete version 6.5 Encoder is included in addition to the legacy
  version 7 Encoder for cases where encoding to work with old or very old
  Loaders is required.

* GUI: Updates, minor fixes and support for PHP 5.4

* Fix to jump optimisations with the PHP 5.3 Encoder for an uncommon code
  sequence. 


Functional changes from previous versions
-----------------------------------------

* Encoded files produced by Encoder 8.0 require a minimum of Loader
  version 4.4.0 to function. 

* License acquisition and release is now possible over the Internet with the
  Linux, FreeBSD and OS X Encoders. 
  
  Use --acquire-license and --release-license for automated processing.

* The manual license request and revoke file generation options from earlier
  versions are deprecated and have been renamed in the Linux, FreeBSD and 
  OS X editions.

* The option to check for unknown extensions is now undocumented as this is
  no longer supported. The option is still accepted for back compatibility
  but has no effect.

Version 7.0.0.3 - 13 Dec 2010
-----------------------------

* GUI: New feature added to support legacy encoding (6.5) as a user
  preference. This brand new feature is a compatibility maximiser,
  giving access to new features of the version 7 GUI while allowing 
  generation of legacy encoded files. Using the version 7 Encoder is
  recommended and is the default, but simply switch to legacy encoding
  using version 6.5 Encoders via the preferences dialog if needing to
  use encoded files to servers running old Loaders (pre version 4). 
  Note that as this feature uses version 6.5 Encoders, new features 
  of the version 7 Encoder (such as the @ syntax) are not available
  when legacy encoding is selected.

* Legacy command line Encoders (6.5) are now bundled with the
  version 7 Encoders for compatibility maximisation.


Version 7.0.0 - 24 Nov 2010
---------------------------

* The Encoder for the PHP 5.3 language is included in this release,
  plus the Encoders for PHP 5 < 5.3 and PHP 4.

* Source directory substitution in wildcard patterns using @

  A leading @/ or @\ in the values for --keep, --ignore, --encode,
  --copy and --encrypt is interpreted as being to the first source 
  item specified.

* Option --ignore-deprecated-warnings added to ignore deprecated
  warnings.

* Option --ignore-strict-warnings added to ignore strict language
  usage warnings.

* GUI: (File menu) The recent files and directories history now
  indicates if an item is missing, and gives an option to remove that
  item from the history.

* GUI: Accessibility enhancements.

* GUI: (Project menu) New options added to quick-build and clean the
  current project.  The build option will process as per the project
  settings with respect to whether an existing target is replaced,
  updated or merged.  Quick-build will perform an update operation 
  and only process files that are new or modified more recently than
  the corresponding item in the target folder. Note that a
  quick-build will not remove items in the target folder that do not
  appear in the source folder, so a clean or full build is
  recommended after changing the structure of the source folder.

* GUI: Preferences dialog added for project defaults and other
  settings.

* GUI: New toolbar icons added for moving to the next/previous parse 
  error within the associated file. When used, the document
  containing the error is opened, and if supported by the editor set
  via the preferences dialog, the cursor will be positioned at the
  line containing the error.

* GUI (user preference): The last open project can be automatically
  opened at startup.

* GUI: The PHP language used (4, 5, 5.3) is added as a visual check
  to the title bar information.

* GUI: Various bug fixes.

* GUI: Event log entries optimised to show shorter paths, and
  date/time display is available as a user preference.

* GUI: Source file edit/view. Source files can now be opened in a
  choice of editors both from the source files tree in project 
  settings and in the relevant nodes of the event tree. 
  The preferred editor is selected as a user preference from a list
  that currently includes: EditPlus 3, Notepad++, GVim, PSPad,
  Programmer's Notepad, PHP Edit or PHP Designer 2007. This list can
  be extended if required by editing an XML document located in the
  installation folder, using the existing entries as examples. 

  If an editor supports opening of a file at a particular position, 
  double clicking a parse error message in the event log will open
  the source file with the cursor positioned at the line containing
  the error.
  
* GUI: The export batch file option is replaced with an Export
  Project feature. This allows a project to be exported as a Windows
  batch file, a command line Encoder project file, or a Unix shell
  script. The exported project script can optionally be updated
  automatically when a project is saved.


Functional changes from previous versions
-----------------------------------------

* Encoded files produced by Encoder 7.0 require a minimum of Loader
  version 4.0 to function. 

* Encoding with strict language rules is now the default, and does
  not need to be enabled with --strict-php.  Deprecated warnings
  (new from PHP 5.3) are also enabled by default.

* New options --ignore-strict-warnings and
  --ignore-deprecated-warnings can be used to suppress strict and
  deprecated warnings.

* PHP 5 Encoder: Code with var instead of public/private/protected
  will no longer give a strict warning if strict warnings are
  enabled.

* GUI: New projects have strict language usage and deprecated
  warnings enabled by default in the project settings (miscellaneous
  tab).

* GUI: Menu and toolbar "Encode" options renamed as "Build" options.

* GUI: The "New Project" Wizard is removed for 7.0.0 and a new
  version will be added in a future revision.

* GUI: Loaders for Windows and Linux are no longer included with the
  product installation to reduce initial download size and to reduce
  the chance of obtaining out of date Loaders. If Loaders are
  required and/or the Loader bundling feature is desired to be used,
  the exact Loaders required can be easily downloaded and made
  available to the GUI after installation.  An "Add Loaders" link on
  the Target tab in project settings now provides a quick way to
  navigate to the relevant Loaders page on the ionCube website.
