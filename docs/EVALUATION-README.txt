to this evaluation version of the Encoder.


FAQ FOR THE EVALUATION VERSION
------------------------------

* WHAT AM I EVALUATING?

The ionCube PHP Encoder is an easy to use, sophisticated and highly versatile
tool for securing PHP code. This evaluation version has all the features of
our top product, the Cerberus Encoder.

A Pro version is also available that is similar to Cerberus but with without
the ability to lock files to machines based on MAC address, and a more limited
Basic version is available that can protect files but has no ability to
make them stop working after a certain time or to limit them to working only
on specific machines.


* WHAT SUPPORT DO YOU OFFER?

If you have any queries when evaluating, please visit https://support.ioncube.com
to create a support ticket and we'll be happy to help. Free support is also included
for a period after purchasing a license, and support plans can be purchased
beyond that as required. If there are suspected faults in the software these
can of course be reported whether you have an active support plan or not, and
we would encourage and welcome you to do so.


* WHAT IS DIFFERENT IN THE EVALUATION VERSION?

All features of the evaluation Encoder are fully functional, however:

1) Encoded files will expire after 36 hours, or sooner if you restrict files to
   expire earlier. Files can be encoded again to continue testing.

2) Encoded files contain a PHP comment to show they are encoded by the 
   evaluation software. This text does not alter operation of encoded files, 
   and is not present in the release version. 


* HOW LONG IS THE EVALUATION PERIOD?

The evaluation version will be functional for 14 days, and can be extended with
a new download if required.
